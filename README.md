# 🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A beginner-friendly **machine learning project** in Python that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of rooms. This project demonstrates a complete **data science workflow** – from data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training to evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **predictive model** that estimates the selling price of a house given its features. This type of project is a common real-world application of regression in machine learning, often used by real estate agencies, investors, and property valuation platforms.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 
* **Format:** CSV
* **Features:**  include

  * Lot area
  * Number of bedrooms
  * Number of bathrooms
  * Year built
  * Square footage
  * Location
  * And other relevant property details
* **Target Variable:** `SalePrice` (house selling price)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `pandas` – Data handling
  * `numpy` – Numerical computations
  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – Data visualization
  * `scikit-learn` – Machine learning models and preprocessing
  * `jupyter` – Notebook environment

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Load the dataset from a CSV file or online source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical variables
   * Feature scaling
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Correlation heatmaps
   * Price distribution plots
   * Feature importance analysis

4. **Evaluation**

   * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   * R² Score
5. **Prediction**

   * Use trained model to predict prices for new input data
